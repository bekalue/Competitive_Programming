## NOTE
The Fibonacci sequence arises naturally in the solution to this problem because of the way the problem is structured. Letâ€™s say that `f(n)` represents the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of a staircase with `n` steps. If you are at step `n`, there are two possible ways to get there: either by taking one step from step `n-1` or by taking two steps from step `n-2`. Therefore, the total number of distinct ways to reach step `n` is the sum of the number of distinct ways to reach step `n-1` and the number of distinct ways to reach step `n-2`. This can be expressed mathematically as `f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)`.

This recurrence relation is the same as the one that defines the Fibonacci sequence, where `F(0) = 0`, `F(1) = 1`, and `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)` for `n >= 2`. Therefore, the solution to this problem is given by the `(n+1)-th Fibonacci` number.

In summary, the Fibonacci sequence is chosen for this problem because it naturally arises from the structure of the problem and provides an efficient way to calculate the solution using dynamic programming or other methods

The number of distinct ways to climb to the top of a staircase with `n` steps, where you can take either `1` or `2` steps at a time, is given by the `(n+1)-th Fibonacci number`. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as `F(0) = 0`, `F(1) = 1`, and `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)` for `n >= 2`.

So, for example, if `n = 2`, the number of distinct ways to climb to the top is `F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2`. If `n = 3`, the number of distinct ways to climb to the top is `F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3`.

* The problem asks for the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of a staircase with n steps, where you can take either `1` or `2` steps at a time.
* This problem can be solved using dynamic programming, which is a technique that can be used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
* The dynamic programming solution uses an array `dp` of length `n+1` to store the solutions to the subproblems.
* The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 2`, which correspond to the number of ways to climb a staircase with `1` or `2` steps.
* The for loop iterates from `3` to `n` and calculates the solution for each subproblem using the formula `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`, which corresponds to the recurrence relation for the Fibonacci sequence.
* Finally, the solution to the original problem is returned as `dp[i]`.
* This dynamic programming approach has a time complexity of `O(n)` and a space complexity of `O(n)`, which makes it much more efficient than the recursive approach for large values of `n`.
